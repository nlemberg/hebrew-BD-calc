# About Hebrew Birthday Calculator

Where I come from, it is a common belief that a person's Gregorian ("normal") birthday and their Hebrew birthday coincide every 19 years. As a child, I pictured these occurrences as special, magical occasions: the universe finally aligning just for me. Imagine my disappointment when I turned 19, and my birthday came, as usual, on two different days.

I created this app to calculate when, if ever, the universe aligns for me.

I invite you to find that out for yourself, [here](https://nlemberg.github.io/hebrew-BD-calc/).

I developed this app using React and designed it entirely in CSS.
